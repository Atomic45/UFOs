## Summary
This is an interesting website for someone that wants to read about UFO sightings. The following recommendations can be considered:

1. It would be more interactive to try to add a search engine in place of filters. This way the user can search for a specific word. This will help in keeping the filters to a minimum, such as, type only the city name in the filter with a "keyword" for the search criteria. 
2. Adding more articles and interesting facts or images will capture the user's interest to continue to use the website. 
3. Ability to update the website for recent sightings, like wikipedia.
